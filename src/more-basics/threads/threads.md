Threads are units of instruction that are waiting to be executed by the CPU. 
CPU executes a thread, one instruction at a time from top to bottom.
Deciding which order to execute these threads in is referred to as scheduling.

Scheduling is controlled by your operating system to 
ways of improving the rate at which we process threads is to either add more cpu cores to our machine or to 
allow our OS scheduler to detect big pauses in processing time due to expensive input and output operations.


multithreading: multiple threades running one one or multiple cpu's.
